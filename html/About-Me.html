          <p>I'm Tyler Morimoto, I live in a family of four with my Dad, Mom, Sister, and me. I also have two dogs. I go to Punahou school and have been in Punahou for 13 years. I am now in my senior year and looking to go to college. I have played some sports and have found lots of interest in computer science.</p>

                 <h5>Updated 9/7/2024</h5>
                 <p>While I have had lots of time with computer science there are other things I have done other than computer science. Some things I have done is been on the bowling team for Punahou and have been in multiple clubs. Another thing outside of school I enjoy is video games and biking. I like to play video games and learn about the more technical side of them. Whether that would be about the code or just the design of the game in general. These have also helped with my interest in computer science.</p>
