        <p>I'm Tyler Morimoto, I live in a family of four with my Dad, Mom, Sister, and me. I also have two dogs. I go to Punahou school and have been at Punahou for 13 years. I am now in my senior year and looking to go to college. I have played some sports and have found lots of interest in computer science.</p>

        <h2>Coding Experinces</h2>
        <h5>Updated 9/7/2024</h5>
        <img 
        <p class="margin">I have had a good amount of coding experience. In middle school, I took a lot of different computer classes working in HTML and game design. While I wasn't the best at it I still found lots of interests in it. Another reason why I found so much interest in computers is my Mom used to work at IT for Punahou, so after school, I would go to her office a lot and hang out with people who work at IT. This exposed me to computers very early on and helped build an interest on how they worked. I have also recently done an internship at Stanford for an AI in Medical course. While this doesn't teach the type of coding we are doing this taught me a lot about how more complicated coding works and how it operates.</p>
